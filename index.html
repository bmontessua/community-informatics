      <h2>Lets bring equity to computer and broadband access.</h2>
      <p>
        We want to bring computing equity to our small towns across North Carolina that may not have access to a library. The solution we are proposing is simple: lets get our faith based institutions and other interested businesses the resources to bring public computing to their locations! <br><br>
        There is no cost associated, we are here to provide our expertice and resources to facilitate the implementation of public computer access or public Wi-Fi! If this sounds interesting to you, please use our form to <a href="contactUs.html">contact us</a> or you can also go <a href="about.html">learn more about us here.</a>
