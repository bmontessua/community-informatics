            Mission
        </h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is simple, we want to provide you with resources, information and training to help empower your business, your community, or yourself with technology. We are not experts but have a growing network of volunteers that can assist you with any information technology related questions. <br><br> We want to empower the community to create a network of accessible Wi-Fi, public computers, and digital navigators to volunteer their time to help others. If you would like to learn more about our mission, please contact us at b_montessua@uncg.edu.

            Faith and Local Partnership Focus
        </h2>
            <p>
                Our main priority is to work with local faith-based institutions to provide implement free Wi-Fi and/or public computing spaces with trained digital navigator volunteers to help their members when access to libraries or family members is not possible. We are also looking for partnerships with local businesses to create public computing spaces where space is available.

            Inclusivity and Equity
        </h2>
            <p>
                We want to bridge the gap between our communities and technology. Within the Graham and Haw River area, the only public library is located downtown. There is a network of churches that, with the training and technology, can implement otherwise underserved communities with the technology they need to fill out important government assistance documents, connect with families, and more, at minimal cost. Bridging this gap in resources throughout our community will empower those without access to broadband or a computer to do essential tasks.
